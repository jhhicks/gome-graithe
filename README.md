DHI-Chicago Fall 2020 Workshop
##############################
This workshop will introduce you to common practices and methods for preparing text for stylometric analysis. 
While there are many beneifts to using XML encoded files, only .txt files will be used. 
The reason for this is two-fold: 
First, in your own research projects you may not have access to xml-encoded texts; 
second, this workshop intends to introduce the participant to entry-level practices and concepts.
